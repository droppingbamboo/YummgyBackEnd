Backend Repository for Capstone Project: Yummgy Recipe Website 

This application was designed to serve as a social network and recipe repository.  The goal was to capitalize on the nostalgic recipes associated with a fictional food products brand, Food Company.  This company has been including recipes on it's products for decades, some of which have become standard fare in modern households.  This web application hopes to encourage consumers to buy branded ingredients for these recipes, instead of opting for cheaper store brands.  

The web application will offer the ability for consumers to add their own recipes and favorite recipes.  This will allow the consumer to create a reference library, which will drive frequent trips to the website.  These frequent trips will allow the Food Company to highlight new products with their associated tested recipes.  

This is our proof of concept iteration with the backbone of navigation implemented with test data.  We are hoping to continue to build on this structure and create a fully-realized application for demonstration purposes.

This is the repository for the back-end code, and the front-end code is housed here: [Yummgy Front-End](https://github.com/ATEOTG/Yummgy-Frontend)
